		<p>This is my Own Note Taker is a free source code
			editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.
			Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GNU
			General Public License.</p>
		<p>Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Note Taker is
			written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher
			execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many
			routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is
			trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less
			CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption,
			resulting in a greener environment.</p>
